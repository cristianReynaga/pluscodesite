      <div class="text"> 
        +CODE is conceived in 2015 as a framework to exhibit and develop the notion of code in art:  In its first edition it presented a selection of works produced using different programming languages.  In this second edition our aim is to work around the language codes employed in the artistic practice -media and technology- to generate a space for reflexion on its themes and its aesthetics.<br>
        <br>
        At the outset we deal with a commonplace: such manifestations tend to focus on the resources employed, which not only pierce their statement but also make the former work around the latter. Facing this situation -repeated in different contexts- we pose the following questions: where is the personal experience of the artist placed? Where does he stand before his living and working contexts? What is this fascination with the tools about?<br>
        <br>
        Besides, if we consider technology as an extension of human senses and abilities, within a world geared towards innovation, how can we handle the tools with the  required expertise to attain an adequate expressive use? <br>
        <br>
        Stemming from these questions, the selection of works has been displayed in accordance with the concerns and thoughts of the artists, to glimpse their conception of a philosophy and an aesthetic in constant change alongside certain thematic axes: human relationship with its environment, the notion of scales within existence, scientific objectiveness, and the power of imagination in foresight.  Their investigations and approaches on time, light, acoustics, anatomy and astronomy express their curiosity about the world we live in and about existence itself; with their concerns founded on scientific knowledge but with the premise of finding new approaches and factors in the equation.<br>
        <br>
        The expressive tools used do not suggest a linear nor predictable road but instead, a creative space where the variety of languages available can express their different intentions. It is this journey and evolution that enable the artists to use and adapt different tools to different contexts.<br>
        <br>
        Just as the production of technologic pieces raises new issues influenced by the logic and language of the tool, we looked for a term that could define the process and lie at the core of its practice.  To speak about transduction -a word used in physics, genetics and literature- enabled us to represent the process of incorporation and conversion of exogenous contexts and experiences into poetic potential
